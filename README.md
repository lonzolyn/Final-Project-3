    This website will allow users to search and view a list of national parks in the USA. 
    They will also be able to search activies and names of the national parks.

## How To Use This Project 
    In the search bar, type in the ParkCode for any of the National Parks in the USA. Typically, the park codes are first four 
    letters of the National Park name. For instance Yellowstone National Park's park code would be "yell". In some cases, the national park code is less obvious (i.e. Sequoia & Kings Canyon's park code is "seki"), in these instances it is recommended to look up the park code on the National Park Service website. 
## Technologies

We utilized the National Park Service Free API to gather information. 
https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm
We also ultized upsplash.com for images and TheNounProject.com for icons. 

## Issues, Bugs and Unfinished Functionalities

    - The group originally planned to create a website that provided information about theme parks in the US, however, an API with the appropriate information was not found. 
    - There were some issues with integrating the API into the frontend of the project
## What we would change in the future
   - Instead of calling parks by their park code, it would be better to call them by their state codes.
